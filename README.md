## ‚ú® Overview

Beats Music is an in‚Äëprogress streaming / playlist style interface. Users can:

- Register / Login with email & password
- Sign in with Google (Firebase Authentication)
- Persist sessions ("Remember me" vs session only)
- View a personalized home experience (after auth redirect)
- Interact with a rich lyric‚Äëaware Song Player (play / pause / seek / like / repeat / shuffle simulation)
- Manage (placeholder) playlist actions (Add to playlist button component)

> NOTE: Audio search, real playlist persistence, and backend catalog APIs are not yet implemented‚Äîcurrent player supports static sample media/lyrics. Contributions welcome.

## üîê Authentication Flow

- `AuthProvider` listens to `onAuthStateChanged` and supplies `User | null` via context.
- Unauthenticated root (`/`) immediately redirects to `/login`.
- Login supports:
  - Email / password with optional persistent session (local vs session storage)
  - Google OAuth popup via `GoogleAuthProvider`
- Register page adds display name via `updateProfile`.
- Basic client side error handling (wrong password, user not found, email in use).

---

## üéµ Song Player Highlights (`SongPlayer.tsx`)

- Local or provided audio source support (HTMLAudio element abstraction)
- Simulated timing fallback when no `audioSrc` (uses interval + lyric timestamps)
- Highlighted current lyric window with sliding focus
- Controls: play/pause, skip prev/next (callbacks), shuffle (UI state), repeat (off / one), like toggle, progress seeking
- Extensible: pass `lyrics`, `audioSrc`, `onAddToPlaylist`, navigation callbacks

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone <your-fork-url> beats-music
cd beats-music
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` in the project root:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxxx.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxxx.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:xxxx:web:xxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-xxxx
```

Obtain these from your Firebase project settings (Web App config). All are exposed as `NEXT_PUBLIC_` because used on client.

### 3. Run Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000 (redirects to `/login` until authenticated).

### 4. Build & Serve Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### 5. Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

| Script  | Purpose                                      |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`   | Run Next.js in development with fast refresh |
| `build` | Production compile + optimize                |
| `start` | Launch built app on Node server              |
| `lint`  | Run ESLint over source                       |

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap / Open Tasks

- Implement real playlist persistence (Firestore or custom backend)
- Song search integration (`/searchSong` placeholder)
- Global state for queue & now playing
- Responsive/mobile layout refinements
- Accessibility pass (ARIA labels, focus outlines in all interactive components)
- Unit / integration tests (React Testing Library / Vitest or Jest)
- Dark/light theming toggle (currently dark focused)

---

## üß© Architecture Notes

- App Router architecture (each folder in `app/` maps to a route)
- Global UI wrappers (`HeaderWrapper`, `SideBarWrapper`) mounted in `layout.tsx` for persistent chrome
- Auth context kept minimal‚Äîconsider expanding to include loading state or roles
- Styling: Utility‚Äëfirst via Tailwind v4; some custom sizing classes appear (ensure Tailwind config supports them if expanded)
- Player uses controlled internal state; could be lifted into a global store when queue logic is introduced

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Firebase keys are public client config (not secrets) but still avoid committing real production analytics projects inadvertently
- Add rate limiting & abuse protection if expanding to public API endpoints
- Validate any future user‚Äëgenerated content (lyrics, playlist names) to prevent injection in rendered markup
